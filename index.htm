        <h1>Major IT Outages are hitting industries across the world</h1>
        <p>With airlines, banking, shops and healthcare affected</p>

        <p>Cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike says a "defect" in one of its software updates hit Windows operating systems.</p>
        <p>"This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed," the firm says.</p>
        <p>The majority of GP surgeries in England are experiencing issues, the NHS says, with trains, shops and pharmacies in the UK also hit.</p>

            <p>A major IT problem is disrupting transport, healthcare, businesses, and other sectors across the world.</p>
            <p>Cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike blames an issue with one of its updates for Windows - it says the problem has been "identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed".</p>
            <p>Crowdstrike's shares are down by more than 20% in unofficial trading in the US - equal to a $16bn loss in value.</p>
            <p>Worldwide, more than 1,000 flights have been cancelled - but American Airlines says flights are resuming again.</p>
            <p>In the UK, NHS England says most GP practices are affected - but there is no known impact on emergency services.</p>
            <p>There are also some delays on the trains - but one operator says it is "not disastrous".</p>

                <p>The US airline says its systems were back up and running by 05:00 ET (10:00 BST).</p>
                <p>"We apologise to our customers for the inconvenience,” it adds.</p>
                <p>As a reminder, the airline - along with many others - stopped flights taking off earlier today, as the IT chaos swept across the world.</p>

                <h2>The biggest IT problem since at least 2017</h2>
                <p class="time">Published at 11:13</p>
                <p>Joe Tidy, Cyber correspondent</p>
                <p>For my money, we’ve not seen as bad an IT issue since the WannaCry cyber-attack in May 2017.</p>
                <p>That was a malicious cyber-attack that affected an old version of Windows and spread automatically and uncontrollably to any computer that had that old and unprotected Windows software.</p>
                <p>It affected an estimated 300,000 computers in 150 different countries. Famously the NHS was badly hit with huge disruption for days.</p>
                <p>In that case, it was an attack that got out of hand. Today's outage was caused by a defect found in a Crowdstrike cyber-security software update.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis">
                <h2>A $16bn problem for Crowdstrike</h2>
                <p class="time">Published at 11:11</p>
                <p>Faisal Islam, Economics editor</p>
                <p>Crowdstrike has lost a fifth of its value in pre-market trading in the US - down 21% in unofficial trading.</p>
                <p>If confirmed when US stock markets open later today, that is a loss of $16 billion in its overnight valuation.</p>
                <p>Industry insiders say the problem is centred on the fact that cloud security companies have very high-level privileges to update the core systems of their customers.</p>
                <p>When this works, it helps protect their systems. When an attempted update fails, it brings down the systems they are supposed to protect, all at once.</p>
                <p>While the fix is in theory, simple - updating systems physically from backup disks - in practice this is now more difficult in a cloud computing world.</p>
                <p>Governments face serious questions about how resilient our economic infrastructure is to this sort of epic failure.</p>
                <p>Does it make sense to allow significant concentration on one company or product?</p>

                <p>Here's the full statement from George Kurtz, the CEO of Crowdstrike:</p>
                <p>"Crowdstrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts.</p>

                <p>It appears that the so-called "Blue Screen of Death" that computers are suffering means that each one needs to get "hands on keyboards treatment".</p>
                <p>That is, it appears to be not something that can be fixed with a central command from an IT administrator in a firm’s HQ. They will need to go and reboot each and every computer affected.</p>
                <p>If it is indeed a Crowdstrike issue that could be a monumental task. Crowdstrike reported having nearly 24,000 customers in its last earnings.</p>
                <p>Each customer is a large organisation, so the number of individual endpoints could be enormous.</p>

                <h2>What is Crowdstrike?</h2>
                <p class="time">Published at 10:34</p>
                <p>Tom Gerken, BBC News</p>
                <p>We don't yet know what is causing the IT outage affecting companies around the world.</p>
                <p>But earlier today American Airlines blamed a "technical issue with Crowdstrike" - and now the Swiss cyber security office is pointing the finger, too (see previous post).</p>
                <p>Crowdstrike is a cybersecurity company founded in 2011 with the aim of safeguarding the world’s biggest companies and hardware from cyber threats and vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p>It specialises in endpoint security protection and tries to prevent malicious software or files from hitting corporate networks from devices that connect to them, such as phones and laptops.</p>
                <p>It also aims to protect the data of companies which have shifted from guarding it under their own roof, or on their own servers, to so-called cloud providers.</p>
                <p>The Texas-based firm was co-founded by entrepreneurs George Kurtz, who remains chief executive, and Dmitri Alperovitch. It listed its shares publicly on the tech heavy Nasdaq stock exchange in 2019.</p>
                <p>Since it first launched, the company has seemingly played a key role in helping firms investigate cyber-attacks.</p>
                <p>In 2016 Crowdstrike was called in by the US Democratic National Committee, the strategy arm of the Democrat Party, to investigate a breach into its computer network.</p>
